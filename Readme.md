# Crowd-Sourced Delivery (Metroco)

## We deliver effortlesly.

We conducted a survey and found out, more than 65% people will be willing to take a delivery from point A to point B in a metro, if that is on their way.

So we are trying to make that happen.

Acc to Delhi Metro, 2011, More than 20 lakh people travel in a metro a day.

So we will be able to get -
1. fast deliveries
2. Without any pollution.
3. Effortlessly/Less Man power.
4. Providing Incentives to the youth travelling.
